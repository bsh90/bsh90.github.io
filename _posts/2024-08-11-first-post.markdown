This is my first post in this blog. I've today took hackerrank.com tests and challenges and several part of java syntax I remembered.
Some examples were
<ul>
<li>using "string.equals(anotherString)" instead of using "=="(I spent hours thinking why this one can not be solved, finally with setting up the code locally and debugging it, I figured it out.)</li>
<li>using Collection.sort(list) for sorting a list</li>
<li>using list.get(index) instead of using list[index]</li>
</ul>
